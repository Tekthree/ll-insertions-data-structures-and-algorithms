## Big O

Analyzing Algorithm / Program efficiency. What we really want look at closely, is how many of code are running and how many times they run, and how much varibales we make, how many references we add, how much resource space we're taking up.  Always analyzed for the the worst.

  * Considerations for space and time.
  * We can think of the notation as comparing the alorithm inputs ( the things the program needs) to th time it takes to run, and the amount space it consumes / uses.
    * As the inputs grow, at what rate does space. time grow

  * Big O: O(n) - linear
  * Big O: O(1) - constant
  * Big O: O(n^2) - exponential
  * Big O: O(logn) - logarithmic
